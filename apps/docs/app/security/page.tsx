      <h2>Secure by default</h2>
      <p>
        Maintania AI uses encrypted data transport, strict service boundaries, and least-privilege access controls.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy-first approach</h2>
      <p>
        We process the minimum data required for classification and documentation suggestions. We do not sell customer data.
      </p>

      <h2>Compliance ready</h2>
      <p>
        Control frameworks and auditability features are designed to support enterprise procurement and compliance reviews.
      </p>

      <h2>Operational integrity</h2>
      <p>
        Access logging, role-based permission controls, and continuous monitoring support secure day-to-day operations.
